        <p class="projects">
          Below is a series of projects I've completed over the course of my school work that I believe 
          showcase my various skills within Computer Science and Computer Engineering. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="project1">
          This first project I had done was a project involving dydnamic programming. The object of this 
          program was to, once run, create a game tree for the children's game "Chopsticks". It did this 
          using dynamic programming. Once the entire game tree was built from the bottom, up, this 
          program would then initiate a game of chopsticks. After each round with the computer and player
          taking a turn, the program would check the game tree to see if it was guarenteed to win, if a 
          tie was possible, or if the player would surely win. Once a game was over, another would start. 
        </p>

        <p class="project2">
          The second project shows my skill at designing and creating circuits using logic gates in order
          to detect a certain key string within a sequence of input bits. It does this by physically 
          creating a state machine where each state represents different progressions within the sequences.
          The sequences to be detected are both '0001' and '1110'.

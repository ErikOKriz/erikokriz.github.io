          Below are projects I've completed which I believe 
          showcase my skills within Computer Science, Engineering, and
		  Cybersecurity. 
        </p>
       
		<p class="project">
			<a href="docs/DNSPoisoning.pdf" target="_blank">DNS Poisoning</a>:
			In this project, I have three virtual machines acting as a user,
			that user's DNS resolver, and a malicious attacker. This attacker
			is able to respond to DNS queries form the resolver by saying that
			any url is directed to its IP address. In this way, the attacker
			can impersonate any website to obtain data form the user.
		</p>

		<p class="project">
			<a href="docs/CSRF_XSSLab.pdf" target="_blank">XSS and CSRF
			Attacks</a>: This project shows how I used Cross Site Scripting and
			Cross Site Referencing attacks to change user data within a sample social
			media site. In both of these cases, I take advantage of the fact
			that users have authenticated cookies for the social media site,
			and then have those users load scripts which use those
			authenticated cookies to change their social media page in ways
			that only they should be able to. 
		</p>

		
		<p class="project">
			<a href="docs/TextEditorC++.pdf" target="_blank">Text Editor</a>:
			This project contains a console-based text editor made entirely
			using C++. The system I built off of a simple display library is
			able to display and edit files, as well as implementing core editor
			functions such as find/replace and Undo/Redo. This system uses a Chain of
			Responsibilty as its keystroke handler. At its core this system
			consists of 3 complex classes, one to old the opened file's data,
			one to display that data, and one to edit the data and/or the view
			based on user input. These classes are created separately and
			contain bridges to one another.
		</p>

		<p class="project">
			<a href="docs/AuthenticatedEncryption.pdf" target="_blank">Authenticated Text
			Decryption</a>: With this project, I demonstrate security concepts
			for a website's database. On this website, authenticated users can
			create text posts for all other users, authenticated or not, to
			see. A user's authenticity is checked by looking at said user's
			session/cookie and if they have a profile associated within them. Upon a text post's creation, authenticated users can choose for the post to
			be encrypted or not. If they do, the text post is stored in the
			site's database as its own ciphertext. In this case, when an
			authenticated user tries to view the post, only then will the
			ciphertext in the database be decrypted and the plaintext post
			shown to the user. If a non-authenticated user attempts to view the
			encrypted post, they will instead see only the ciphertext. If a
			post is non-encrypted, then non-authenticated users can also see
			the plaintext.
			the post.

        <p class="project">
        <a href="docs/Chopsticks.pdf" target="_blank">Chopsticks</a>
          : This project is centered around dynamic programming. The object of this 
          program was to, once run, create a game tree for the game "Chopsticks". It did this 
          using dynamic programming. Once the entire game tree was built from the bottom, up, this 
          program would then initiate a game of chopsticks. After each round with the computer and player
          taking a turn, the program would check the game tree to see if it was guarenteed to win, if a 
          tie was possible, or if the player would surely win. Once a game was over, another would start.

        <p class="project">
          <a href="docs/sequenceDetection.pdf" target="_blank">Sequence Detection</a>
          : This project shows my skill at designing and creating circuits using logic gates by creating a circuit
          that detects two specific key strings within a sequence of input bits. It does this by physically 
          creating a state machine where each state represents different progressions within the sequences.
          The sequences to be detected are both '0001' and '1110'. When the machine detects that one of 
          these strings has been processed through the machine, a detection LED lights up.

        <p class="projects">
          Below are a series of projects I've completed over the course of my schooling that I believe 
          showcase my various skills within Computer Science and Computer Engineering. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="project1">
          First is a project I had done involving dynamic programming. The object of this 
          program was to, once run, create a game tree for the game "Chopsticks". It did this 
          using dynamic programming. Once the entire game tree was built from the bottom, up, this 
          program would then initiate a game of chopsticks. After each round with the computer and player
          taking a turn, the program would check the game tree to see if it was guarenteed to win, if a 
          tie was possible, or if the player would surely win. Once a game was over, another would start. 
        </p>

        <p class="project2">
          This project shows my skill at designing and creating circuits using logic gates by creating a circuit
          that detects two specific key strings within a sequence of input bits. It does this by physically 
          creating a state machine where each state represents different progressions within the sequences.
          The sequences to be detected are both '0001' and '1110'. When the machine detects that one of 
          these strings has been processed through the machine, a detection LED lights up.
